# RolePlayingGame
Specifications:
## User Interface (UI):

The next programmer must complete the user interface (UI) so that players can create their characters intuitively. This involves designing and connecting input fields, buttons, and interface elements.

## Event Handling:

Implement the necessary code to handle events such as character creation, combat, gaining experience, and leveling up.
## Combat System:

Develop the logic for the combat system. This includes the interaction between characters and enemies, calculating damage dealt and received, and determining the outcome of battles.
## Character and Enemy Management:

Create a data structure to keep track of the characters and enemies present in the game. This will allow players to engage in battles and gain experience.
## Levels and Experience:

Implement the logic for characters to gain experience after each battle and level up when they reach certain experience points. As they level up, their attributes may improve.
## Character Classes:

Create the different character classes (warrior, mage, etc.) and define the unique skills and characteristics of each class.
## Enemies and Battles:

Generate enemies with varying levels of difficulty and characteristics. Allow players to engage in battles with these enemies.
## Game States:

Implement different game states, such as character creation menu, exploration mode, and battles. Switch between these states based on game progression.
## Screens and Messages:

Display messages and informative screens to inform players of their progress, combat results, and important events.
## Data Persistence:

If you want to save game progress, implement a data persistence system, such as saving and loading game states.
## Testing and Debugging:

Conduct thorough testing to identify errors and ensure that the game functions correctly. Make corrections and debug as needed.
## Documentation:

Write clear and comprehensive documentation explaining how the game works, how to create new character classes, add enemies, etc. This will facilitate future modifications and improvements.
## Optimization and Polishing:

Optimize the code and polish the user interface to enhance the player experience and make the game more appealing.
